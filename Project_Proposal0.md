# Create a Classification Model to Help Doctors Treat Diabete Patients.
<br>

##  Question/Need:
Target of this project are doctors with patients that show evidence that they might have diabetes and what to do to either prevent or take control of it. The machine learning program will help doctors have an easier time to diagnose patients. The goal is to provide doctors with a machine learning model that will assist them in diagnosis, treatment, medication, and other ways to handle or prevent the patient from having diabetes. If the patient does have diabetes, they can use the model to help the patient with treatment.

##  Data Discription
The data gathered was from this link [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Diabetes from 130 US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). 
This data set has 100,000 number of instances with 55 features or attributes. The feature consist of patient number, race, gender, age, admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting physician, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test result, diagnosis, number of medication, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization, etc. This dataset will be used to build a predictive model to help doctors diagnose patients in a more efficient way.

##  Tools
- Python to create a machine learning program. The program will use classification models to build a prediction model. Using pandas to create a database for diabetes, SKlearn library to perform Using kNN dicision regions to help build a classification model. Then apply a logistic regression to the training data set to see how accurate it is in determining if a patient has diabetes or not. 
- Visualization tools like Google sheets or Tableau.

##  MVP Goal
- Build a baseline model to determine if a patient 
- Provide some graphs that using classification model will be an effective prediction method to assist. 
- Provide a graph to show accuracy with a training set of data.
- With added complexity, it will show that the model will allow for accuracy.
