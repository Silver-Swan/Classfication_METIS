# Detecting occular disease using machine learning. [Name of Project]
<br>
### Question/Need <br>
Target of this project are doctors that specialize in eyes. The machine learning program will help doctors an easier time to diagnose(sp) patients. 
<br>
### Data Discription <br>
Data gathered was from [Kaggle: Ocular Disease Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k). 
This data set has 4,691 data point with 8 features. The feature consist of normal (non-disease patient) eyes, diabetes patients eyes, glaucoma patient eyes, cataract patient eyes, age related Macular Degeneration patient eyes, hypertension patient eyes, pathological Myopia patient eyes, and other diseases/abnormalities(sp) patient eyes. 
<br>
### Tools <br>
- Python to create a machine learning program. The program will use classification models to build a prediction model.
- Using kNN to first ... 
<br>
### MVP Goal <br>
- Provide some graphs that using classification model will be an effective prediction method to assist. 
- Provide a graph to show accuracy with a training set of data.
- With added complexity, it will show that the model will allow for accuracy.
